# What is Breakout?
Breakout is my take on a Breakout clone that is written in C++. I'm doing this to gain a basic understanding of creating an OpenGL based application. I am also interested in using different compilers so I will be using CMake and learn that with this project.
I'll be using [this](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout) tutorial as reference.

## Dependencies
