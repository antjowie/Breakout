# What is Breakout?
Breakout is my take on a Breakout clone that is written in C++. I'm doing this to gain a basic understanding of creating an OpenGL based application on Windows.  
I have no interest in making this project support multiple platform which is why I have chosen [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/getting-started/) as my build tool. My focus for this project lies into correct use of abstraction and encapsulation because I am planning on reusing parts of this code.   
I'll be using [this](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout) tutorial as reference.

## Building the project
I use [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/getting-started/) to build the project. In the projects folder there is a solution file. Just build the solution file and the binaries will appear in a bin folder located at the root of the repository.

I'm using OpenGL 4.6 for the project. 

## Dependencies
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
